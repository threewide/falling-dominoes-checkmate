# <03-Module>

## Description

For the 03-Module project we were given an html file, css style sheet and a javascript with that was setup to with a button that that once we implement it would generate a password. The password length and usage of uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numerals were queried and some validation was added. I was unable to fully implement the logic to use what the user input to adjust the password. For example if they said lower case only for the password it would still generate with all of the lower, upper, numerals and special characters. I believe I know how to solve it but will need a bit more time to finish it.
